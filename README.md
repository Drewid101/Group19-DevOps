## Overview

The project is a **Population Reporting System** that generates reports on global, continental, and regional populations using the `world.sql` dataset.
It demonstrates **DevOps principles** such as CI/CD, automated builds, containerization, and collaborative development.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this system is to:

* Provide population insights across different geographic levels.
* Showcase integration of databases, automation tools, and DevOps pipelines.
* Enable continuous improvement and teamwork in software delivery.

---

## Requirements

Before running the project, make sure the following are installed and configured:

**JDK 24** – Ensure JDK 24 is installed and set as default
**Maven 3.9+** – For build automation and dependency management
**MySQL Database** – Import the `world.sql` dataset before running the application
**Git / GitHub** – For version control and collaboration

---

## Build and Run
To build and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clean the project**:

    ```bash
    mvn clean
    ```

2. **Validate the project**:

   ```bash
   mvn validate
   ```

3. **Compile the project**:

   ```bash
   mvn compile
   ```

4. **Package the project**:

   ```bash
   mvn package
   ```

5. **Run the project using Docker Compose**:
   Ensure you have a `docker-compose.yml` file in your project directory, then run:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

This will build the Docker image and start the application as defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

6. **After packaging, run the application with:**:

    ```bash
    java -cp target/gp19CourseWork.jar com.napier.gp19.App
    ```
   After run local App.java will connect the database of Docker-Compose and  Markdown Report Files will be generated in the project root directory.

# 📋 PMD Code Style Fix Report

## Rule: LocalVariableNamingConventions
### 🔍 Description

PMD enforces that **local variable names** follow standard Java naming conventions:

* Must begin with a **lowercase letter**
* Should use **camelCase**
* Underscores (`_`) are **discouraged** 
* Should be descriptive and readable

---

### ❌ Before
Underscores used in local variable naming:

```java 
        String countries_Continent = "Asia";
```

### ✅ After
CamelCase used instead:
```java
        String countriesContinent = "Asia";
   ```

### 🛠 Explanation
The variable like `countries_Continent` violates PMD’s `LocalVariableNamingConventions` rule because:


* It contains an underscore
* It mixes lowercase and uppercase in an inconsistent format
* It does not follow Java camelCase style

Renaming it to countriesContinent resolves the PMD violation and aligns with Java standard naming practices.

## Rule: ConstantNamingConventions
### 🔍 Description
PMD requires static final fields (constants) to be named using uppercase letters with underscores (SNAKE_CASE).

#### ❌ Before
```Java
    private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(MyClass.class.getName());
   ```

#### ✅ After
```Java
   private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(MyClass.class.getName());
   ```

### 🛠 Explanation
PMD flagged logger for breaking constant naming rules.
Renaming it to LOGGER ensures it follows the uppercase constant naming convention for static final fields.

## Rule: MethodNamingConventions
### 🔍 Description

PMD enforces that method names must follow standard Java naming conventions:

* Method names must be written in lowerCamelCase 
* Should NOT contain underscores (_)
* Should start with a verb describing the action (e.g., get, set, compute, build)
* Must be descriptive, readable, and consistently formatted

#### ❌ Before
Underscores used in method name:
```Java
   public ArrayList<Country> getCountries_World_Report(Connection conn);
```

#### ✅ After
CamelCase method name following Java convention:
``` Java
    public ArrayList<Country> getCountriesWorldReport(Connection conn);
```

### 🛠 Explanation
The original method name getCountries_World_Report violates PMD’s MethodNamingConventions rule because:

* It contains multiple underscores 
* It is not in Java's standard lowerCamelCase format 
* PMD flags underscores in method names unless they are test methods (e.g., JUnit naming pattern)

Renaming the method to getCountriesWorldReport ensures:
* Compliance with PMD rules
* Proper Java naming convention
* Improved readability and consistency across the codebase
